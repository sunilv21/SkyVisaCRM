# Follow-Up Feature Implementation - Complete

## Overview
Implemented comprehensive follow-up functionality for daily logs, including database storage, filtering, and display.

## Changes Made

### 1. Backend Updates

#### Updated Log Model (`server/models/Log.js`)
Added new fields to support complete log functionality:

```javascript
{
  customer: ObjectId (ref: Customer),
  note: String (required),
  addedBy: ObjectId (ref: User),
  type: String (enum: ["call", "email", "meeting", "note"], default: "note"),
  subject: String,
  outcome: String (enum: ["positive", "neutral", "negative"], default: "neutral"),
  followUpRequired: Boolean (default: false),
  followUpDate: String (ISO date string),
  duration: Number (in minutes)
}
```

#### Updated Controller (`server/controllers/customerController.js`)

**addLogToCustomer** - Now saves all log fields:
```javascript
const logData = {
  customer: req.params.id,
  note,
  addedBy: req.user._id,
  type: type || "note",
  subject: subject || "",
  outcome: outcome || "neutral",
  followUpRequired: followUpRequired || false,
  followUpDate: followUpDate || null,
  duration: duration || 0,
};
```

**getAllLogs** - Returns all log fields:
```javascript
{
  id, customerId, customerName, date,
  type, subject, description, duration,
  outcome, followUpRequired, followUpDate,
  employeeName, employeeId, createdAt
}
```

### 2. Frontend Updates

#### Updated Customer List (`client/components/customer-list.tsx`)
Modified `handleSaveLog` to send all log fields to the API:

```typescript
body: JSON.stringify({ 
  note: log.description,
  type: log.type,
  subject: log.subject,
  outcome: log.outcome,
  followUpRequired: log.followUpRequired,
  followUpDate: log.followUpDate,
  duration: log.duration
})
```

#### Enhanced Daily Log List (`client/components/daily-log-list.tsx`)
Added comprehensive filtering system:

**New Filters:**
1. **Follow-up Status Filter**
   - All Logs
   - Follow-up Required
   - Upcoming Follow-ups (future dates)
   - Overdue Follow-ups (past dates)

2. **Employee Filter**
   - All Employees
   - Individual employee selection
   - Dynamically populated from logs

**Filter Logic:**
```typescript
// Follow-up filtering
if (followUpFilter === "required") {
  matchesFollowUp = log.followUpRequired === true
} else if (followUpFilter === "upcoming") {
  matchesFollowUp = log.followUpRequired === true && 
                   !!log.followUpDate && 
                   new Date(log.followUpDate) >= new Date()
} else if (followUpFilter === "overdue") {
  matchesFollowUp = log.followUpRequired === true && 
                   !!log.followUpDate && 
                   new Date(log.followUpDate) < new Date()
}

// Employee filtering
matchesEmployee = employeeFilter === "all" || log.employeeId === employeeFilter
```

**UI Improvements:**
- Two-row filter layout for better organization

- Follow-up badge displayed on logs requiring follow-up
- Follow-up date prominently shown in orange alert box
- Employee name badge on each log
