# Daily Logs Database Fetching Fix

## Problem
Daily logs were not being fetched from the database. The application was trying to fetch logs from local storage instead of the MongoDB database.

## Root Cause
1. The `getCustomerLogs()` function in `client/lib/api.ts` was using `getDailyLogs()` from local storage
2. There was no backend API endpoint to fetch all logs from the database
3. Both admin and employee pages were iterating through customers and trying to fetch logs individually, which was inefficient

## Solution

### Backend Changes

#### 1. Created New Controller Function (`server/controllers/customerController.js`)
Added `getAllLogs` function to fetch all logs from MongoDB:

```javascript
export const getAllLogs = async (req, res) => {
  try {
    // Fetch all logs with customer and addedBy information
    const logs = await Log.find()
      .populate("customer", "name email")
      .populate("addedBy", "name email")
      .sort({ createdAt: -1 }); // Most recent first
    
    // Transform logs to match frontend DailyLog format
    const transformedLogs = logs.map(log => {
      const logObj = log.toObject();
      return {
        id: logObj._id.toString(),
        customerId: logObj.customer?._id?.toString() || "",
        customerName: logObj.customer?.name || "Unknown",
        date: logObj.createdAt ? new Date(logObj.createdAt).toISOString().split('T')[0] : "",
        type: "note",
        subject: "",
        description: logObj.note,
        outcome: "neutral",
        followUpRequired: false,
        employeeName: logObj.addedBy?.name || "Unknown",
        employeeId: logObj.addedBy?._id?.toString() || "",
        createdAt: logObj.createdAt
      };
    });
    
    res.json(transformedLogs);
  } catch (error) {
    console.error("Get all logs error:", error);
    res.status(500).json({ message: "Failed to fetch logs", error: error.message });
  }
};
```

**Key Features:**
- Fetches all logs from MongoDB
- Populates customer and employee (addedBy) information
- Sorts by most recent first
- Transforms MongoDB format to match frontend DailyLog interface
- Includes proper error handling

#### 2. Added New Route (`server/routes/customerRoutes.js`)
```javascript
// Logs routes (must come before /:id routes)
router.get("/logs/all", protect, getAllLogs);
```

**Important:** The route is placed before `/:id` routes to prevent Express from treating "logs" as a customer ID.

### Frontend Changes

#### 1. Created New API Function (`client/lib/api.ts`)
Added `getAllLogsFromDB()` function:

```typescript
export async function getAllLogsFromDB(): Promise<DailyLog[]> {
  try {
    const API_BASE_URL = process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL || "http://localhost:5000/api"
    const authSession = localStorage.getItem("crm_auth_session")
    const token = authSession ? JSON.parse(authSession).token : null

    const response = await fetch(`${API_BASE_URL}/customers/logs/all`, {
      headers: {
        "Authorization": `Bearer ${token}`
      }
    })

    if (!response.ok) {
      console.error("Failed to fetch logs:", response.statusText)
      return []
    }

    const logs = await response.json()
    console.log("Fetched logs from database:", logs.length)
    return logs
  } catch (error) {
    console.error("getAllLogsFromDB error:", error)
    return []
  }
}
```

#### 2. Updated Employee Page (`client/app/employee/page.tsx`)
Changed from:
```typescript
const allLogs: DailyLog[] = []
for (const customer of loadedCustomers) {
  const customerLogs = await getCustomerLogs(customer.id)
  allLogs.push(...customerLogs)
}
setLogs(allLogs)
```

To:
```typescript
// Fetch all logs from database
const allLogs = await getAllLogsFromDB()
setLogs(allLogs)
console.log("Loaded logs:", allLogs.length)
```

#### 3. Updated Admin Page (`client/app/admin/page.tsx`)
Applied the same change as employee page.

## Benefits

1. **Performance**: Single API call instead of N calls (one per customer)
2. **Accuracy**: Fetches from actual database instead of local storage
3. **Real-time**: Gets latest logs from MongoDB
4. **Efficiency**: Reduced network overhead
5. **Scalability**: Works with any number of customers

## API Endpoint

**GET** `/api/customers/logs/all`

**Headers:**
- `Authorization: Bearer <token>`

**Response:**
```json
[
  {
    "id": "log_id",
    "customerId": "customer_id",
    "customerName": "John Doe",
    "date": "2025-10-04",
    "type": "note",
    "subject": "",
    "description": "Customer called to inquire about visa status",
    "outcome": "neutral",
    "followUpRequired": false,
    "employeeName": "Jane Smith",
    "employeeId": "employee_id",
    "createdAt": "2025-10-04T11:24:50.000Z"
  }
]
```

## Files Modified

### Backend
1. `server/controllers/customerController.js` - Added `getAllLogs` function
2. `server/routes/customerRoutes.js` - Added `/logs/all` route

### Frontend
3. `client/lib/api.ts` - Added `getAllLogsFromDB` function
4. `client/app/employee/page.tsx` - Updated to use new API
5. `client/app/admin/page.tsx` - Updated to use new API

## Testing

1. **Employee Dashboard:**
   - Login as employee
   - Navigate to "Daily Logs" tab
   - Verify logs are displayed
   - Check browser console for "Loaded logs: X" message

2. **Admin Dashboard:**
   - Login as admin
   - Navigate to "Daily Logs" tab
   - Verify all logs from all employees are displayed
   - Check browser console for "Admin: Loaded logs: X" message

3. **Add New Log:**
   - Add a new log from customer list
   - Refresh the page
   - Verify the new log appears in Daily Logs tab

## Console Logging

Added console logs for debugging:
- `"Loading data from database..."` - When data fetch starts
- `"Loaded customers: X"` - Number of customers loaded
- `"Loaded logs: X"` - Number of logs loaded
- `"Fetched logs from database: X"` - API response

## Notes

- Logs are now fetched directly from MongoDB
- Employee users only see their own logs (filtered by `employeeId`)
- Admin users see all logs from all employees
- The old `getCustomerLogs()` function remains for backward compatibility but is no longer used in main pages
- All logs are sorted by creation date (most recent first)
